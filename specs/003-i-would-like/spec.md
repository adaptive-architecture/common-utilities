# Feature Specification: Version-Aware ConsistentHashing.HashRing

**Feature Branch**: `003-i-would-like`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I would like to implement a new version of ConsistentHasing.HashRing that keeps track of it's previous configurations. The usecase is the following: we start with 2 servers, we add a third server, while an external system migrates the data we would need the HashRing to return a list of possible options: first it should return the current allocated server and second the preiously configured one, once the external team finishes the migration we can clear the history. The history length should be configurable with a default of 3. If you try to add another version and the limit is exceed we should throw an exception."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üìö **For Utilities**: Focus on cross-cutting concerns that can be packaged as standalone libraries

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - **For Utilities**: Library boundaries, public API surface, extension points

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: When server configurations change (add/remove servers), what triggers the creation of a new configuration version in the history? ‚Üí A: Only when explicitly requested by calling a "snapshot" method
- Q: When querying for servers and the hash ring has configuration history, how many total servers should be returned from all configurations combined? ‚Üí A: Return one server from each configuration version (current + all historical)
- Q: When attempting to create a configuration snapshot that would exceed the history limit, what should happen to make room for the new snapshot? ‚Üí A: Throw an exception and prevent the snapshot
- Q: For concurrent access scenarios during data migration, should the version-aware hash ring be thread-safe when multiple threads access configuration history simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Similar to HashRing
- Q: When a key's responsible server is the same across multiple configuration versions (current and historical), should that server appear multiple times in the returned server candidates list? ‚Üí A: No, return each unique server only once regardless of version overlap

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a distributed system developer, I need a version-aware hash ring that maintains previous server configurations during data migration periods, so that my system can support gradual data migration between old and new server topologies while ensuring data availability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a hash ring with 2 servers, **When** I add a third server, **Then** the hash ring maintains both current (3 servers) and previous (2 servers) configurations for key lookup
2. **Given** a hash ring with configuration history, **When** I query for servers handling a key, **Then** I receive the current server first, followed by the previous configuration server
3. **Given** a hash ring at maximum history length (3), **When** I attempt to add another configuration, **Then** the system throws an exception preventing history overflow
4. **Given** a hash ring with configuration history, **When** external migration is complete and I clear the history, **Then** the hash ring only maintains the current configuration

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the history limit is reached and a new configuration snapshot is attempted? (Exception is thrown to prevent exceeding limit)
- How does the system handle clearing history when no history exists?
- What occurs when requesting servers from an empty hash ring with history?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain a configurable history of previous hash ring configurations with a default limit of 3 versions
- **FR-002**: System MUST return unique server candidates in priority order: current configuration server first, then servers from historical configurations, with each unique server appearing only once
- **FR-003**: System MUST throw an exception when attempting to add a new configuration that would exceed the configured history limit
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a method to clear configuration history, retaining only the current configuration
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow configuration of the maximum history length during hash ring initialization
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all existing HashRing functionality while adding version-awareness capabilities
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle edge cases gracefully when history is empty or hash ring contains no servers
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide an explicit method to create configuration snapshots that capture the current server topology into the history

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST maintain the same thread-safety characteristics as the existing HashRing implementation for all version-aware operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration Snapshot**: Represents a specific state of the hash ring at a point in time, containing server topology and virtual node mappings
- **Server Candidate**: A server that can handle a given key, ordered by configuration priority (current first, then historical)
- **History Manager**: Manages the collection of configuration versions and enforces history limits

### Library Design *(include for utility features)*
- **Library Scope**: Extends the existing ConsistentHashing.HashRing to support version-aware operations for data migration scenarios
- **Public API Surface**: New methods for retrieving prioritized server lists, clearing history, and configuring history limits; extends existing HashRing interface
- **Integration Points**: Extends existing HashRing<T> class, reuses IHashAlgorithm interface for hash computations, leverages VirtualNode<T> for configuration snapshots; maintains full backward compatibility with existing API
- **Dependencies**: No additional external dependencies beyond current ConsistentHashing module requirements
