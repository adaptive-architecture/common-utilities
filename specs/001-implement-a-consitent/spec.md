# Feature Specification: Consistent Hash Ring Utility

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-a-consitent`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement a consitent hash/hash ring utility that can be used to determine the endpoint/server to use for a speciffic request. The main usecasee for this would be to determine HTTP requests routing or Database connection selecton  based on some id (bytes)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ï¿½  Feature description provided: consistent hash ring for request routing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ï¿½  Actors: developers, routing systems; Actions: hash, route, select; Data: endpoints, requests, IDs
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ï¿½ Hash algorithm preference - Provide SHA1 and MD5 hashing options but allow configurability
   ï¿½ Virtual node count - configurable per server, default to 42
   ï¿½ Thread safety is required - Use concurrent collections for safe multi-threaded access
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ï¿½  Clear user flows for endpoint selection and dynamic scaling
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ï¿½  Each requirement testable via unit tests
6. Identify Key Entities
   ï¿½  HashRing, Node, VirtualNode identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ï¿½ ï¿½ Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ï¿½ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- =ï¿½ **For Utilities**: Focus on cross-cutting concerns that can be packaged as standalone libraries

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer building distributed systems, I need a consistent hash ring utility so that I can reliably route requests to the same server/endpoint even when nodes are added or removed from the system, ensuring minimal data redistribution and maintaining session affinity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a hash ring with 3 servers (A, B, C), **When** I hash a request ID "user123", **Then** the same server is consistently selected across multiple calls
2. **Given** a hash ring with 3 servers, **When** I add a 4th server (D), **Then** only requests that would naturally map to server D are redistributed, while other requests continue mapping to their original servers
3. **Given** a hash ring with 4 servers, **When** server B becomes unavailable, **Then** requests that were mapping to server B are redistributed to the next available server in the ring
4. **Given** multiple threads accessing the hash ring simultaneously, **When** concurrent requests arrive, **Then** thread-safe operations ensure consistent routing without race conditions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the hash ring is empty (no servers configured)?
- How does the system handle duplicate server identifiers?
- What occurs when all servers become unavailable?
- How does the system behave with extremely large numbers of servers (1000+)?
- What happens when the input ID is null or empty?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST consistently map the same input ID to the same server across multiple calls
- **FR-002**: System MUST support dynamic addition of servers with minimal request redistribution
- **FR-003**: System MUST support dynamic removal of servers with automatic failover to next available server
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle concurrent access safely in multi-threaded environments
- **FR-005**: System MUST support configurable virtual nodes per physical server to improve distribution balance
- **FR-006**: System MUST accept byte arrays as input for maximum flexibility with different ID types
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide enumeration of all configured servers for monitoring purposes
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle hash collisions gracefully without losing servers
- **FR-009**: System MUST support custom server identification beyond simple strings

*Areas requiring clarification:*
- **FR-010**: System MUST use the configured algorithm for consistent hashing
- **FR-011**: System MUST create the configured number of virtual nodes per physical server
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide concurrent collections thread safety guarantees

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **HashRing**: The main container that manages the circular hash space and server distribution
- **Server/Node**: Represents a physical endpoint (server, database connection, etc.) that can receive routed requests
- **VirtualNode**: Represents multiple hash positions for a single physical server to improve distribution uniformity
- **RequestID**: The input identifier (as byte array) used to determine routing destination

### Library Design *(include for utility features)*
- **Library Scope**: Provides consistent hashing for distributed system request routing and load balancing
- **Public API Surface**: HashRing class with Add/Remove server methods, GetServer(byte[]) routing method, and server enumeration capabilities
- **Integration Points**: Integrates with .NET dependency injection, supports IEquatable servers, and provides extension methods for common ID types (string, Guid)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal dependencies - only requires System.Collections.Concurrent for thread safety and System.Security.Cryptography for hashing
